　　庭院里长着绒花树的人家，有个女儿叫秀生。跟小我三岁的弟弟在一个班级，人长的漂亮，有时候辫子上插着朵红绒花，就显得更加漂亮，都说她象电影《五朵金花》里演金花的演员。曾让弟弟给她索要绒花树的种子，秀生大方地给了一大把。绒花树的种子，呈咖啡色，比绿豆粒略小而扁。在自家院子里挖坑浇水，小心翼翼地把花种埋进去，就天天盼着它出芽。等得不耐烦时，忍不住扒开土看，有几次都把嫩芽扒折了。母亲说象你这样扒来扒去，种子受了风，就出不来了。好象真被母亲说中了，种下去的绒花树种子再也没有发芽。

Return to a subject we started drinking again.
Or with the friend, when it comes to drinking in the Lord Jesus, after listening to my friend had an explanation, my understanding is that the bible does not expressly prohibited drinking believers, cautioned against excessive only to avoid disorderly (understand it I don't know how many reasons, please show me).
